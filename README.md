# MysticVerse-KabirDasCouplets-Hin2EngTranslation
Hello, World! This is a simple readme file about my current ongoing project.
The proposed model adopts a comprehensive approach, leveraging both Machine Translation techniques and innovative methodologies to tackle the complexity inherent in translating Hindi poetry. It emphasizes the integration of efficient translation techniques, including neural machine translation, statistical methods, and rule-based systems, acknowledging the nuances of language and cultural nuances embedded within the couplets. Central to the model's efficacy is the implementation of word sense disambiguation techniques, such as semantic analysis and contextual disambiguation, crucial for accurate and contextually relevant translations. Furthermore, the model explores the possibility of combining these techniques into a hybrid model, capitalizing on the strengths of each approach to enhance translation quality. MYSTIC VERSE is an advanced NLP-based machine translation system designed to accurately translate the profound and culturally rich couplets (dohas) of the revered Indian poet Kabir Das from Hindi to English. Kabir Das's couplets, known for their philosophical depth and spiritual wisdom, present a significant challenge in maintaining their essence and nuances during translation. MYSTIC VERSE aims to bridge this linguistic and cultural gap, enabling a broader audience to appreciate the timeless wisdom of Kabir Das. By prioritizing the translation of Hindi couplets, the model contributes to bridging the linguistic and cultural divide, fostering greater understanding and appreciation of Indian literature within the global NLP community.
